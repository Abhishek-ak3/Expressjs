Progressive web apps (PWA) are web applications that look and feel like native mobile apps but can be accessed through a web browser. PWAs are designed to work offline, be fast, and provide a seamless user experience across different devices. They thus adapt to the user's browser, screen size, and device specifications. PWAs are becoming increasingly popular among businesses and developers, as they offer many of the benefits of native mobile apps without needing a separate app store.",

But the same technologies that have the potential to help billions of people live happier, healthier, and more productive lives are also creating new challenges for citizens and governments around the world. From election meddling to data breaches and cyberattacks, recent events have shown that technology is changing how we think about privacy, national security, and maybe even democracy itself. In this project, we examine challenges in five key areas that will shape the future of the digital age: justice system, impact on democracy, global security and international conflict, the impact of automations and AI on the jobs marketplace, identity, and privacy. Explore provocative and through-provoking topics on how technology impacts our lives",
